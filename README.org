#+title: Untexify - a bad clone of [[https://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html][Detexify]]
* What this is
This is a placeholder repo for a future Tensorflow project I intend to complete by [2023-03-27 Mon].
* Road-map
- [-] Create the dataset
  - [X] Pull a large list of symbols from [[https://oeis.org/wiki/List_of_LaTeX_mathematical_symbols][OEIS]]

    I simply copied a table's symbols and formatted them into a file such that each piece of LaTeX was on its own line.
  - [X] Convert them into .png files

    I used [[https://github.com/mtyrolski/latex2image.git][latex2image]] to convert the list of commands into small, square images of each symbol. The program is a bit finnicky, so for future reproduction, I placed the file of my equations called ~equations.txt~ the root of the git repository, then ran from the root:
    #+begin_src bash
    cd src/
    . set.sh $absolute_path_to_equations_txt
    cd ..
    cd equations.txt_aux
    python generate_latex.py
    #+end_src
    I numbered the resulting files using Dired.
  - [X] Sort them into classes based on their latex code
    I created my [[./images/][images/]] folder, and used this bit of bash magic to sort them into folders sharing their same names:
    #+begin_src bash
    for i in $(seq 0 $IMAGE_COUNT); do mkdir $i; mv $i.png $i/; done
    #+end_src
    Which resulted in:
    #+begin_src bash :results
    ls ./images
    #+end_src
