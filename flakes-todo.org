* How to actually use this project

1. If envrc is broken (i.e. "No poetry executable found" when doing =M-x poetry s=), you have to reload direnv in this project.

   You can accomplish this through some black-magic combination of:

   - =envrc-allow=
   - =envrc-reload=
   - =cd= ing out of the directory in vterm and then back in again

2. Run =pyvenv-activate= and point it to the .venv directory here

   This is to make =run-python= look for the right executable

3. Use =run-python= to open the interpreter

   + Use =C-u run-python= to manually point to the right python interpreter if weird import errors occur

4. If poetry complains about incorrect versions, make sure that you have the correct version of python installed as required by =pyproject.toml=.

   As of [2023-09-28 Thu] this should be handled by the =pythonPkgs= import.

5. The newer model used by this project (as of [2023-10-13 Fri]) is too large to push to git. It is in [[id:0ef0366f-6e8b-4610-9a11-78a816c73a21]].
